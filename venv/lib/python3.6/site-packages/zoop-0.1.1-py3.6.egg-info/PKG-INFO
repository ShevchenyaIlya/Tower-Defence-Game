Description: Zoop - ZooKeeper for Python!
        ============================
        
        `Zookeeper`_ is a highly reliable distributed coordination service.
        
        *Zoop* gives you a Pythonic API for accessing ZooKeeper instances, as well as
        implementations of some common ZooKeeper patterns. This leaves you free to
        concentrate on whatever it was you were originally doing::
        
            >>> zk =  zoop.ZooKeeper('localhost:2181')
            >>> zk.connect()
            >>> q = zk.Queue('/howdy')
            >>> def gotit(data):
            ...     print "Gotit got data:", data
            >>> q.watch(gotit)
            >>> q.put("frist!")
            Gotit got data: frist!
